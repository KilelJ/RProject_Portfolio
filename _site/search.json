      "contents": "\nAnalyzing Factors Affecting Student Performance\nProject Overview:\nIn this project, I sought to establish the predictors of student performance in order to identify the predictors that have a strong influence on the level of test score and probability of passing a test. Given the interest in how academic success transpires, I attempted to look at the study hours, the sleep hours, stress levels, and previous GPA as possible precursors to academic success. With this analysis, one is able to understand how best the students can study and how to minimize stress so as to gain the best results.\nLoading The Necessary Libraries\n\n\n\nLoading Data- Simulation\n\n  study_hours sleep_hours stress_level previous_gpa exam_score\n1  -5.6047565   -2.018928            1     3.197672   64.73033\n2  -2.3017749   -5.936986            1     3.618469   58.30551\n3  15.5870831   14.267851            2     3.071930  146.11228\n4   0.7050839   11.510613            2     2.275276   86.44658\n5   1.2928774  -11.091665            1     3.134934   68.05530\n6  17.1506499    3.048525            3     3.669343  128.49903\n  exam_pass\n1         0\n2         0\n3         1\n4         1\n5         0\n6         1\n\nDescriptive Statistics\n\n  study_hours        sleep_hours       stress_level    previous_gpa  \n Min.   :-26.6092   Min.   :-24.098   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.689  \n 1st Qu.: -5.7463   1st Qu.: -2.884   1st Qu.:2.000   1st Qu.:2.628  \n Median :  0.2072   Median :  3.988   Median :3.000   Median :2.996  \n Mean   :  0.3459   Mean   :  3.977   Mean   :2.952   Mean   :2.987  \n 3rd Qu.:  6.8521   3rd Qu.: 10.433   3rd Qu.:4.000   3rd Qu.:3.294  \n Max.   : 32.4104   Max.   : 30.917   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :4.322  \n   exam_score       exam_pass    \n Min.   :-46.32   Min.   :0.000  \n 1st Qu.: 50.22   1st Qu.:0.000  \n Median : 75.21   Median :1.000  \n Mean   : 74.13   Mean   :0.554  \n 3rd Qu.: 96.21   3rd Qu.:1.000  \n Max.   :195.84   Max.   :1.000  \n             study_hours   sleep_hours  stress_level previous_gpa\nstudy_hours   1.00000000 -0.0519369070 -0.0298736776 0.0934026781\nsleep_hours  -0.05193691  1.0000000000 -0.0001663458 0.0136777547\nstress_level -0.02987368 -0.0001663458  1.0000000000 0.0002296351\nprevious_gpa  0.09340268  0.0136777547  0.0002296351 1.0000000000\nexam_score    0.76451556  0.4884418456 -0.2194729470 0.2135898190\nexam_pass     0.58645302  0.3738913551 -0.1722160483 0.1791584061\n             exam_score  exam_pass\nstudy_hours   0.7645156  0.5864530\nsleep_hours   0.4884418  0.3738914\nstress_level -0.2194729 -0.1722160\nprevious_gpa  0.2135898  0.1791584\nexam_score    1.0000000  0.7822680\nexam_pass     0.7822680  1.0000000\n\n\nFitting Linear Regression and Logistic Regression Models\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = exam_score ~ study_hours + sleep_hours + stress_level + \n    previous_gpa, data = student_data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-38.254  -6.582   0.727   6.922  38.284 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Study hours have a significant positive impact on exam scores. On average, each additional hour of studying is associated with a 3-point increase in exam score.\n2. Sleep hours also positively affect performance. Students who sleep more tend to score higher on exams.\n3. Stress level negatively impacts exam performance. Higher stress levels are associated with lower exam scores.\n4. Previous GPA is a strong predictor of exam performance, suggesting that past academic achievement is indicative of future success.\n5. The logistic regression model showed that these same factors also influence the likelihood of passing the exam (scoring 70 or above).\n6. Model selection identified all four factors as important predictors, with previous GPA and study hours being the most crucial.\n7. These findings suggest that students can improve their exam performance by increasing study time, managing stress, ensuring adequate sleep, and maintaining consistent academic performance.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nIn this project, I conducted an assessment of the independent variables that have the potential of affecting the dependent variables which include the general test performance as well as the pass rate of the student. With the help of different statistical models and writing R programs, I analyzed the impact that study hours, sleep hours, stress levels, and previous GPA have on academic success.\nCourse Learning Objectives\n1. Describe probability as a foundation of statistical modeling, including inference and maximum likelihood estimation\nIn my project, I applied the binary logistic regression whereby I hoped to show the likelihood of the students passing the examination and this depended on study hours, sleep hours, stress levels, and previous grade point average.\nThe application of a logistic regression model is useful for further explaining how the probability concepts underlie the framework of statistical modeling. The maximum likelihood estimation enabled me to identify the model most appropriate to estimate the probability to pass the exam, an aspect that proved that probability informs inference and decision making while conducting statistics.\n2. Determine and apply the appropriate generalized linear model for a specific data context\nIn the given analysis I have employed both the linear regression and logistic regression techniques. I used a linear model for fixed effects and for the continuous outcome variable of examination scores while using a logistic model for the categorical dependent variable, pass/fail in the examination.\nIn case of the continuous outcome, I applied the linear regression analysis to determine the relationship between the study hours, sleep hours, and stress level/previous GPA with the exam scores. For the binary outcome, I used Logistic regression to predict the probability of passing. This proved my competency on how to choose and use the right generalized linear model according to the density of the data and the research questions.\n3. Conduct model selection for a set of candidate models\nHere, model selection was done through stepwise selection for regression based on linearity and LASSO regression for logistic regression model.\nBackward elimination also known as backward step-wise method involved in elimination of insignificant variables from the model with the help of certain statistical measures. For the logistic model, LASSO was employed to determine the best number of predictors that can be used while at the same time avoiding over-fitting. This process also demonstrated that I can select and choose the best model from two or more models.\n4. Communicate the results of statistical models to a general audience\nI ensured that I gave a straightforward and concise analysis of my results at the end of my work.\nThe summary has provided clear descriptions and elaboration of the relationship between each predictor and the exam performance like the study hours and previous GPA which were given as positive and the stress which was given as negative. Such clear communication made the results easily understandable by anyone in the population as well as exercising corporate understanding on those findings.\n5. Use programming software\nI used R in data simulation, fitting the models, as well as evaluation.\nDetailed work-wise, R was very useful in processes such as fitting logistic regression; selection of models using LASSO and performance analysis by ROC curves. This is evident through my ability to adequately use the programming software for statistical modeling and analysis and that stresses my prowess in the use of R on the job.\nContribution to Course Community\nI actively attended class, discussed with other students about the projects and coursework, and critiqued their work. My participation improved my understanding and benefited the course group by promoting teamwork and assisting fellow students.\n\n\n\n",
